  "body": "### What's ADAGIO?\r\nADAGIO implements an approach for assessing dominance in gregarious species based on directed acyclic graphs. In contrast to other approaches, our algorithm does not assume that all entities in a group have to be comparable. In addition to the ADAGIO algorithm, the code also implements other dominance assessment approaches including Elo, David's score and I&SI. \r\n### How to use ADAGIO \r\nIn short, make sure you have java installed on your system. Then download the ADAGIO package [here](https://github.com/ngonga/adagio/releases) and follow the instructions  at that page.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nThe framework was implemented by Axel Ngonga (@ngonga). If you use this framework, please cite \r\n\r\n**Pamela Heidi Douglas, Axel-Cyrille Ngonga Ngomo and Gottfried Hohmann**.\r\nA Novel Approach for Dominance Assessment in Gregarious Species: ADAGIO. Submitted to PLOS Computational Biology.\r\n\r\n### Datasets\r\nFor datasets to test ADAGIO, see [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B2pYB_O1g_JRR3ViZFpKTHUwSlk).\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with ADAGIO? You are on your own :) No, feel free to add a ticket [here](https://github.com/ngonga/adagio). Note that ADAGIO is provided with a GPLv3 license.
